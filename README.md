# Better Command

Made you immune and untargetable when you open artifact of command menu

There is a few things
- When you are on the command menu it doesn't reset the damage on the void, it will keep stacking up.
 This means you can died insantly when you pick an item in the void and sit on the command menu long enough.

- Drone are not immune so when you enter the command menu all the monsters will target your drones

- All health stuff are disabled when entering the command menu so health regen, shield regen, etc are not going to work.
  There is a caveat for the shield though the shield regen will be stopped but the shield count down before it regen is not

- Equipments are still enabled
