# Better Command

Made you immune and untargetable when you open artifact of command menu

There is a few things
- When you are on the command menu it doesn't reset the damage on the void, it will keep stacking up.
 This means you can died insantly when you pick an item in the void and sit on the command menu for long enough. 
 This is good so you can't abuse this in the void field to loot it before branching all the cells

- All of your drones and turrets will not attack when you are on command menu as they also get untargetable and immune buff

- All health regen will be stopped on the command menu
